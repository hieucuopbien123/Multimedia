Analog data with the highest harmonic at 50 kHz generated by a sensor has been digitized using 6 level PCM. Find the rate at which digital signal generated?

Giáº£i: 
In Pulse Code Modulation (PCM), the digital signal's sampling rate is determined by the Nyquist theorem, which states that in order to accurately represent a signal without any loss of information, the sampling rate should be at least twice the highest frequency component of the analog signal.

Given that the analog data has the highest harmonic at 50 kHz, the Nyquist theorem suggests that the minimum sampling rate should be at least 2 * 50 kHz = 100 kHz to avoid aliasing and accurately represent the original signal.

Now, the digital signal generated using 6-level PCM means that we are using 6 quantization levels to represent the analog signal. In PCM, the number of bits used to represent the signal levels determines the number of quantization levels. With 6 levels, we can represent the signal using 3 bits (2^3 = 8, but one level is used for signaling errors or other purposes, leaving us with 6 usable levels).

The formula to calculate the bit rate for PCM is given by:

Bit rate (R) = Sampling rate * Number of bits per sample

Substituting the values:

Sampling rate = 100 kHz
Number of bits per sample = 3

Bit rate (R) = 100 kHz * 3 bits/sample = 300 kbps

So, the digital signal generated using 6-level PCM has a bit rate of 300 kbps.
